Meteor Seed
================

Meteor-Seed helps you scaffold a project quickly for the Meteor javascript framework.

Project structure is:

+ __client__ contains files for the browser-side app.
+ __server__ is everything on the server.
+ __commons__ includes components shared by the client and the server. It is a good place to define your Mongo collections.
+ __packages__ (optional) holds additional plug-ins and Meteor-flavored plugins.
